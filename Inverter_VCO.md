## Overview : 
The inverter-based Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) design hinges on the utilization of a cascade of inverter stages, forming what is commonly known as a ring-oscillator circuit. In this configuration, feedback is established by looping the output of the final inverter back to the input of the initial inverter. The VCO functionality is achieved by modulating the number of inverters in the cascade, and thus, the current carrying capability of these inverters. Altering the current carrying capability impacts the charging time within the inverter module, consequently influencing the propagation delay. Specifically, a reduction in the current carrying capability extends the charging time, leading to an increase in propagation delay and, consequently, a higher oscillation frequency at the output. Conversely, an increase in the input DC voltage results in a decrease in frequency.

It is crucial to highlight that an odd number of inverters is requisite in the ring-oscillator stage to sustain oscillation effectively. The asymmetry introduced by an odd number of stages ensures a phase shift of 180 degrees with each inverter, fostering the necessary conditions for sustained oscillation. This phase relationship is pivotal in preventing constructive interference that could otherwise disrupt the oscillation.

While the inverter-based VCO design offers versatility in frequency tuning, it is not without its challenges, particularly concerning power consumption. The power dissipated by a ring oscillator is directly proportional to the number of stages employed. As more stages are incorporated into the cascade, the switching activity increases, resulting in elevated power consumption. This aspect is of paramount concern, especially in the context of battery-operated devices where minimizing power consumption is essential for prolonging battery life. Engineers and designers must strike a delicate balance between achieving the desired oscillation characteristics and managing power dissipation, particularly in applications where energy efficiency is a critical consideration.

This relationship underscores the direct proportionality between power dissipation and the square of the supply voltage, emphasizing the need for thoughtful design considerations to optimize the performance of inverter-based VCOs in various electronic applications.
