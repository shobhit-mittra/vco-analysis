# VCO Basics :

Oscillators are used in various applications, including laptop and smartphone processors for generating clock signals, radio, and mobile receivers for generating local carrier frequencies, and signal generators in labs to test circuits. Oscillators generates periodic AC signals of varying frequencies when given a DC voltage and the output can be either sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal. The main concept of oscillator revolves around the fact that they do not require an active input for operation. The block diagram of oscillators can be examined in the fig1. An oscillator consists of an amplifier and a positive feedback circuit, where the feedback takes the amplified circuit to another input of the circuit, forming a closed loop. The feedback signal determines the stability of sustainable oscillations. Thermal noise provided by every circuit gives an initial boost to the amplified output, leading to the establishment of oscillations at the output. The loop gain AÎ² and phase shift are crucial factors for sustained oscillations, and their relationship is mathematically proven.
